# Tracing System Enhancement TODOs

This file tracks missing trace events that should be implemented for complete CPS simulation verification

DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE - It's for internal tracking only

## HIGH PRIORITY - COMMUNICATION Level Events

### Message Tracing (COMMUNICATION level)

- [x] Implement MESSAGE_SEND tracing in FrostProtocolMng._update_variable_callback()
- [x] Implement MESSAGE_SEND tracing in FrostProtocolMng response creation methods
- [x] Implement MESSAGE_RECEIVE tracing in FrostProtocolMng.handle_request()
- [x] Add tests for message tracing in test_tracing.py
- [ ] Update tracing example to demonstrate message tracing

### Subscription Management (COMMUNICATION level)

- [x] Add SUBSCRIBE event type and tracing in VariableNode.subscribe()
- [x] Add UNSUBSCRIBE event type and tracing in VariableNode.unsubscribe()
- [x] Add tests for subscription tracing

### Notification Events (COMMUNICATION level)

- [x] Add NOTIFICATION event type and tracing in VariableNode.notify_subscribers()
- [x] Track which subscribers are notified and when

## MEDIUM PRIORITY - FULL Level Events

### Control Flow Tracing (FULL level)

- [ ] Implement CONTROL_FLOW_STEP tracing in ControlFlow.execute()
- [ ] Add tracing for individual ControlFlowNode.execute() calls
- [ ] Add tracing for CompositeMethodNode._start_execution() and resume_execution()
- [ ] Add tests for control flow tracing at FULL level

### Remote Execution Tracing (COMMUNICATION level)

- [ ] Add REMOTE_EXECUTION_START event in RemoteExecutionNode.execute()
- [ ] Add REMOTE_EXECUTION_END event in RemoteExecutionNode.handle_response()
- [ ] Add tracing for CallRemoteMethodNode, ReadRemoteVariableNode, WriteRemoteVariableNode
- [ ] Add tests for remote execution tracing

### Scope Lifecycle (FULL level)

- [ ] Add SCOPE_CREATED event in CompositeMethodNode._create_scope()
- [ ] Add SCOPE_DELETED event in CompositeMethodNode.delete_scope()
- [ ] Add SCOPE_ACTIVATED/DEACTIVATED events in control flow execution

## LOW PRIORITY - Error/Debugging Events

### Error/Exception Tracing (METHOD/COMMUNICATION level)

- [ ] Add ERROR_RESPONSE event type for protocol error responses
- [ ] Add tracing in _create_error_response() calls
- [ ] Add METHOD_FAILURE event for method execution errors
- [ ] Add validation failure tracing

### Performance/Optimization Events

- [ ] Add MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE events for monitoring message backlogs
- [ ] Add SUBSCRIBER_COUNT events for monitoring subscription load
- [ ] Add SCOPE_COUNT events for monitoring active executions

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Event Type Additions Needed

- SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE
- NOTIFICATION
- REMOTE_EXECUTION_START/REMOTE_EXECUTION_END
- SCOPE_CREATED/SCOPE_DELETED/SCOPE_ACTIVATED/SCOPE_DEACTIVATED
- ERROR_RESPONSE
- METHOD_FAILURE

### Trace Level Mappings

- SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE/NOTIFICATION: COMMUNICATION
- REMOTE_EXECUTION_*: COMMUNICATION
- CONTROL_FLOW_STEP: FULL
- SCOPE_*: FULL
- ERROR_RESPONSE/METHOD_FAILURE: METHOD or COMMUNICATION

### Testing Strategy

- Add COMMUNICATION level tests to test_tracing.py
- Add FULL level tests to test_tracing.py
- Create integration tests with protocol manager
- Update examples to demonstrate new tracing levels

### Backward Compatibility

- All new events should be optional based on trace level
- Existing tracing should remain unchanged
- New event types should follow existing patterns</content>
